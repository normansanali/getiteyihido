The report also alleged Alyson was uncomfortable with how close Barry had grown to their nurse.</p><p>“They’ve grown apart over recent months and things have finally come to a head,” the source alleged. “His partying caused arguments.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Alyson also suspects he has got close to someone else and is adamant there is no going back,” they went on. “As far as she’s concerned, it’s over.”</p><p>For now, Barry hasn’t addressed the allegations that he was asked to leave the Irish hotel. However, he has made it clear he’s moving on from his relationship, even if the dust has just settled. Barry has been seen hanging out with Sabrina Carpenter, who some fans have noticed has an uncanny resemblance to Alyson.</p><p>"It definitely seemed like a date,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider told PEOPLE</a> after spotting Barry and Sabrina on a date night, noting the pair weren’t afraid to engage in PDA in front of onlookers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmqqirnqssc6gn5qmXaiwprrEZp%2BorJWheqO%2BzqScZq2gYrSqvsufqaKdnpl8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbarry-keoghan-scene-hotel-broke-up-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbarry-keoghan-scene-hotel-broke-up-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbarry-keoghan-scene-hotel-broke-up-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbarry-keoghan-scene-hotel-broke-up-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbarry-keoghan-scene-hotel-broke-up-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbarry-keoghan-scene-hotel-broke-up-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brandon-arreaga.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brandon-arreaga.html>Brandon Arreaga - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aaliyah-net-worth-2.html>Aaliyah Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aaliyah-net-worth-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
