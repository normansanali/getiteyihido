He gushes about his commitment to his six-year-old daughter and his love of being a girl dad. He describes his little girl as the human form of coffee before adding that she is just like him.</p><p>Gabby, on the other hand, while definitely moved by Nate’s fatherly love, also confessed that she is unsure about becoming a mother so soon.
