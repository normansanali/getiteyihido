Indonesian rapper, who is also known by the moniker Daniel Armand Lee.&nbsp;The most famous of his work is his involvement in his South Korean hip-hop group Epik High.&nbsp;He is also a DJ and tv host, he’s hosted shows like Tablo’s Dreaming Radio.</p><p>The year 2012 was the time that he and co-eds Epik High members released a single that featured vocals from Korean reality show Finalist&nbsp;In 2012, he and his fellow Epik High members released a single featuring vocals by Korean reality talent competition finalist <a href=#>Lee Hi</a>..</p><p>Daniel Armand Lee (Korean: Lee Seon-woong; Hangul: 이선웅; born July 22, 1980), better known by his stage name Tablo (Hangul: 타블로), is a Korean-Canadian hip hop recording artist, lyricist, composer and record producer. Tablo is best known as the leader and producer of veteran Korean hip-hop group Epik High, and the founder of independent music label HIGHGRND (High Ground), which housed bands Hyukoh and The Black Skirts.</p><p>Tablo has been a long-time fan of hip hop music, citing an almost lifelong affair with the culture itself. While listening to hip hop at an early age through artists such as Run-D.M.C. and acquiring Cold Crush tapes, he concurrently gained recognition as a rhymer. His major and enduring love affair with making hip hop music was sparked later in life, however; after hearing Drunken Tiger rapping, the group Epik High was formed in 2000 at an early time in the culture’s local evolution. Tablo has since claimed to be the first emcee to have used the “rhyming rifle” technique. With the hip hop scene in Korea and Korean emcees being known for their fickle tendencies, Tablo has through the years kept alive his legacy and career through numerous shows, appearances on influential overseas (American most notably) hip hop artists work, such as EPMD.</p><p align=justify>The couple, along with their wife South Korean film and TV actor&nbsp;He and his wife, South Korean film and television actress <a href=#>Kang Hye-jung</a>, welcomed their first child, a daughter named <a href=#>Haru</a>, in 2010.&nbsp;were blessed with their first baby, a daughter named&nbsp;Haru&nbsp;Haru, in 2010.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tablo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tablo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1980</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Seoul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Korea</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tablo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

They formed Epik High and under the tutelage of Movement crew members, especially CB Mass (currently Dynamic Duo), they attempted to record their first record alongside hip-hop duo, and close friends, TBNY (composed of Yankie and TopBob). However, CB Mass member Curbin allegedly embezzled Epik High and TBNY’s funds for their first studio album, effectively causing the disbandment of CB Mass (and the creation of Dynamic Duo without Curbin). Tablo and Epik High were finally signed by Woolim Entertainment, which at the time focused on underground hip hop and modern rock. Tablo made his official debut as the leader of the group Epik High in 2003 alongside DJ Tukutz and Mithra Jin. The group’s first album, Map of the Human Soul, was released on October 21, 2003. However, due to hip hop’s lack of popularity in South Korea at the time, the album was a commercial failure. It wasn’t until the release of their second album, High Society, that the group started to become more popular. Epik High’s third album, Swan Songs, was originally intended to be their last album; however, upon release, the album became number one on numerous charts, and swept the year-end hip hop awards. One of the lead singles from the album, “Fly”, was featured on the soundtrack of the video game FIFA 07. Due to the numerous offers to remake “Fly”, as well as “Paris”, the second single from the album, a CD sampler, was released in Japan.</p><h2>Tablo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tablo is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from South Korea.

The album ended up becoming South Korea’s third best-selling album of 2007. However, many songs from the album were banned from several channels and the album buying age was restricted to 19+ due to some songs dealing with issues the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in South Korea deemed inappropriate for younger listeners. The group later went on to release their next album, Pieces, Part One, which was also a commercial success.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tablo height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Tablo <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Tablo became employed as a lyricist while still in high school.

The Korean translation sold 50,000 copies in its first week of release and topped the bestseller’s list in Korea. The original English version was released in February 2009 and also met with moderate success. The book garnered a positive reception from critics, with Tablo’s writing praised for a first-time author. After the group’s contract with Woolim Entertainment expired in 2008, Tablo, alongside his group members, founded their own independent label, Map the Soul, and they went on to release an album of the same name. Through their independent label, the group went on to release two more albums; [e] in 2009, and Epilogue in 2010.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in South Korea</strong>. Tablo celebrates birthday on July 22 of every year.</p><p align=justify>It became front-page news in Korea in June 2010 when one of the fansite’s managers, who went by the username whatbecomes, claimed that Tablo’s academic record was “not making any sense” and showed what he believed to be inconsistencies in Tablo’s transcripts. Even though Tablo posted his official transcript and other legal documents online, many netizens refused to believe him, and called for other documents such as his immigration statement and diploma to be released. Tablo visited Stanford University in late August to disprove these allegations by having the University registrar re-print his documents on camera, and many of Tablo’s acquaintances and former professors from Stanford attested to the validity of his academic background on camera. The documentary was shown in two parts: “Tablo Goes to Stanford” and “Tablo and South Korea Online”, which aired on MBC October 1 and 8. However, despite the documentary and Stanford’s administration clearly siding with Tablo, membership at “We Demand the Truth from Tablo” increased to as many as 190,000 within a few days, as numerous netizens refused to believe Tablo or the documentary. Tablo and members of his family received death threats and he became a virtual recluse. Tablo ultimately left Woollim Entertainment during the Tajinyo incident, not wanting to spread harm to the agency or to Infinite, who had only recently debuted when the controversy broke out.</p><h3>What does a Tablo do?</h3><p>Tablo is <b>a DVR for cord cutters who use an Over-the-Air antenna to watch free live, local TV</b>.
