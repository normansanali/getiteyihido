Chris Columbus has a great Joe Pesci story, which is really fun to hear about since fans can never get enough of watching Kevin go after Marv and Harry.</p><footer><a href=../../home-alone-cast-daniel-stern-what-happened-where-are-they-now.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../j-coles-net-worth-2024.html>J Coles Net Worth 2024</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

Turner-Smith revealed that she opted for a home birth due to the systemic racism that affects Black women in hospitals across the country.
