<time>20 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>After speaking on her friendship with fellow artist<a href=#> French Montana </a>in a handful of interviews, <a href=#>Trina</a> confirmed that the two were never in a relationship, during an interview with Power 105.1’s <a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a>.</p><p>She explained that the two, who met at Puff Daddy’s birthday party exactly two years ago, were really good friends and added that French’s lack of maturity was one reason why they never pursued anything beyond their friendship.</p><p>“We really was not in a relationship,” Trina said. “Let’s be clear about that. I never told him that I was your girl. There’s a lot of reasons. I guess now we can see why. Because you just got a lot of growing up to do. I could come up here and expose you and bash you, but I’m so much better than that. I’m not gonna do that. But I will say this, we were friends. And as being friends today as we speak makes two years I would have known you…I think a relationship to me starts with friendship. I think that me and him kinda was on the same page, but different pages kinda. He had a situation. He was going through a divorce or whatever. That was one of the reasons why I never really got into a relationship with him. I wanted that to be clear. And it was a lot of back and forth, but I was there with you every single day and step of the way while you was dealing and going through that. Beyond supportive. I’m the one that told you to step up to the plate like a man and make the right choice.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Trina then detailed the type of relationship she had with French. She says the Bronx, New York rapper always stayed at her house whenever he was in Miami, Florida and revealed that if it wasn’t for her, those outside of New York wouldn’t know who French Montana is.</p><p>“The friend that when you came to Miami you never slept in a hotel cause you stayed at my house every single time,” she said. “The friend that I have the keys to your house still right now today. That kind of friend. The friend that everything you post on your Instagram, your whole house, how it looks, I did that. The friend that sends and imports stuff, furniture, all kinds of stuff from Miami to New York. I did that. That kind of friend. So, let’s be clear on the friend thing since you want to be so messy about it. Because we were friends…First and foremost, nobody besides New York even paid you attention until me.”</p><p>The Miami rapper then spoke on her relationship with Lil Wayne, who she referred to as “a great person.” The two were engaged at one point, but ultimately broke off their engagement.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Wayne is a great person,” Trina said. “He’s really a good [guy]. He’s a great guy as a man…When I was in a situation with Wayne so many years ago I think we were both just so young. I didn’t even think that we was in nothing. It just was like—We were friends and we just hung out and we was good. But it was like there’s a proposal. About to get married. It was just so much happening I was like ‘This can’t be real.’”</p><p>Trina’s interview with The Breakfast Club can be found below.</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong><a href=#>Trina Talks Bonding With Nicki Minaj & Glass Ceiling For Females In Rap</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZjZoBxgY6toK2klWPBs7XNmmSsmamoeqe%2BxKeaoWWdpLu1rc2aZKGZo2KubrjOrWSonl2cv7DDyKeeZq2gYsGwecOo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftitle-trina-says-french-montana-has-a-lot-of-growing-up-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftitle-trina-says-french-montana-has-a-lot-of-growing-up-to-do.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftitle-trina-says-french-montana-has-a-lot-of-growing-up-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftitle-trina-says-french-montana-has-a-lot-of-growing-up-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftitle-trina-says-french-montana-has-a-lot-of-growing-up-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftitle-trina-says-french-montana-has-a-lot-of-growing-up-to-do.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-clive-owen-after-closer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-clive-owen-after-closer.html>What Happened to Clive Owen After 'Closer'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./seasons-spice-pairings-winter.html>Seasons &amp;amp; Spice Pairings: Winter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./seasons-spice-pairings-winter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
