Unlike some of the girls on the reality show, Siwa was not afraid to speak her mind when it came to dance coach, Abby Lee Miller.</p><p>Over the years, Siwa was applauded by fans for speaking her mind and being herself. Be it coming out as gay in 2021, calling out Nickelodeon after they did not invite her to the Kids' Choice Awards in 2022, or defending the LGBTQIA community in 2022 when Candace Cameron Bure stated the reason she moved from Hallmark to Great American Family was to make "traditional marriage" movies, Siwa's fans rallied around her.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jason-Aldean-with-Jojo-Siwa-and-Candace-Cameron-Bure.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Really Went Down Between JoJo Siwa And Full House's Candace Cameron Bure?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>JoJo Siwa has some beef with Full House star, Candace Cameron Bure, but what really happened and is Hilary Duff's husband involved?</span><p><a href=#>In 2023, Siwa pretended to be pregnant</a>, but her fans defended her because they felt there was no malice in Siwa's harmless joke.

Given that Siwa had just broken up with her girlfriend, Avery Cyrus in December 2022, fans were confused by what they were seeing.</p><p>At the time, <a href=#>it was rumored that Siwa had a secret girlfriend</a>. Fans wondered if the pregnancy could be true and took screengrabs of the Snapchat in which Siwa had on-screen captions that read, "Can't believe it" and "Baby clothes shopping is my new favorite thing." Needless to say, the pictures went viral nearly immediately.</p><p>Some fans expressed their concern with Siwa being pregnant given that she was still a teenager. Others stated the post was nothing more than Siwa with a "food baby" after having eaten a large meal. Fans were unable to agree on what was happening.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jojo-siwa-1.jpg><p>Because the rumors of Siwa would not die down, according to Business Insider, Siwa took to TikTok to state she was not pregnant. This seemed to be the end of the pregnancy rumors and fans seemed relieved.</p><p>However, at the end of March, the "pregnancy" pictures again began to circulate. This time, a screengrab from Snapchat showed an on-screen caption that stated, "TEAM BOY OR TEAM GIRL."</p><p>Siwa returned to social media to make fun of the viral posts claiming she was pregnant. This time, according to Business Insider, Siwa and her friend Ezra Sosa filmed a Snapchat with Siwa holding her sweatshirt up. Sosa can be heard saying, "You know everyone thinks I'm the dad, right?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The on-screen caption read, "The father of my baby!!"</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Siwa posted yet another Snapchat that showed her shopping for baby clothes. Needless to say, fans were perplexed with what to believe.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jojo-siwa-in-an-interview.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is The Lack Of Scandal Surrounding Jojo Siwa An Indication Of Something Sinister?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>JoJo Siwa has a squeaky clean image, but some people think it's a bit deceiving.</span><p>It was later revealed that Siwa was not pregnant but was buying clothes for pregnant fans who may need them.</p><p>While this should have been seen as a positive thing that Siwa was doing, she was instead criticized for pretending to be pregnant, which was confusing given that Siwa tried to dispel the pregnancy rumors just weeks before.</p><h2 id=why-jojo-siwa-was-criticized-for-the-pregnancy-rumors>Why JoJo Siwa Was Criticized For The Pregnancy Rumors</h2><h3 id=critics-didn-39-t-like-that-jojo-joked-about-pregnancy>Critics didn't like that JoJo joked about pregnancy</h3><p>Even though Siwa tried to shut down the pregnancy rumors at the beginning of March 2023, the same pictures and more circulated later that month. Given that the first time Siwa made a video about not being pregnant it was essentially ignored, she did what she thought was best and that was to make fun of the situation. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In making light, however, Siwa came under fire by many</a>. But it should be noted that none of the people calling Siwa out were her devoted fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It’s rude and hurtful to pretend to be pregnant when there is so many individuals struggling with fertility," one Reddit user wrote.

Some even pointed out that while it might be "clickbait," Siwa was not trying to make light of women who were unable to get pregnant. However, the controversy continued for weeks, until it finally died down in April 2023.</p><p>Though being criticized for a joke is never fun, there is something good that came out of the situation: Siwa donating a large amount of baby supplies to fans in need.</p><h2 id=the-positive-that-came-from-the-jojo-siwa-pregnancy-rumors>The Positive That Came From The JoJo Siwa Pregnancy Rumors</h2><h3 id=jojo-siwa-reportedly-donated-baby-goods-to-people-in-need>JoJo Siwa reportedly donated baby goods to people in need</h3><p>As Siwa was shopping for baby clothes and supplies, it was revealed that the shopping spree was not for her. Instead, all things baby were going to be donated to Siwa's fans. However, it was not Siwa that broke this news to fans.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some X (formerly Twitter) users informed social media just what Siwa's intentions were with the baby supplies</a>. They were also part of the group that explained just why Siwa should be praised for what she was doing and not chastised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>X user @siwa_gay broke the news that Siwa was buying new baby clothes "for giving away to mothers in need."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jojo-siwa-4-1.jpg><p>"Say what you want about JoJo Siwa," a second X user wrote, "but her buying brand new baby clothes to send to expecting mothers and newborn babies' families is so pure."</p><p>While it was these users who broke the news that Siwa was giving away baby supplies, it has never been disclosed whether Siwa donated said supplies. Nor has it been disclosed just what Siwa was trying to donate.</p><p>However, fans are convinced that Siwa is a woman of her word. They have not found evidence to show that Siwa did not donate and because of this, Siwa's fans are standing by their stories that Siwa is generous and was just trying to help mothers in need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7yru4ysoLCZXZuurLHDZphmqKKatK%2BtzZywaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-jojo-siwa-faked-a-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-jojo-siwa-faked-a-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-jojo-siwa-faked-a-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-jojo-siwa-faked-a-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-jojo-siwa-faked-a-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-jojo-siwa-faked-a-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./josh-brolin-cable-haircut-deadpool-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./josh-brolin-cable-haircut-deadpool-2.html>Josh Brolin Unveils His Cable Haircut For Deadpool 2</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./richard-harris-obituary.html>Connersville Mourns: Richard Harris Obituary Beloved Member Passes Unexpectedly at Age 60</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./richard-harris-obituary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
