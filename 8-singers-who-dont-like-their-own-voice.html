It is surprising how many famous singers actually hate the way their voice sounds in their songs. Some grow to like their voice eventually, and others go their <a href=#>whole career hating their sound</a>. Here are eight singers who hate the way their singing voice sounds.</p><h2 id=lorde><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lorde</span></h2><p>Despite the song Royals being the hit that launched her career, the singer hates the way her voice sounds in the song. Even when she listens to other people sing it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she does not like the melody</a> or the harmony. She avoids listening to it because she feels like her voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Does she feel this way about the songs <a href=#>on her new album</a>?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mac-miller><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mac Miller</span></h2><p>Many of this late rapper's songs have parts where he sings along with his rap verses. His singing lines were his least favorite ones because he did not like the sound of his singing voice at all. He would add these verses only because his fans enjoyed them. Regardless of how he felt about his voice, his fans would give anything to hear him sing again.</p><h2 id=jimi-hendrix><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jimi Hendrix</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being one of the most successful and most celebrated rock stars in history, Jimi Hendrix was not a fan of the sound of his voice. This was especially true when he heard his voice on records. He could not stand it because he was insecure about his sound. The sound of his voice challenged his perception of himself, and he really did not like it.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>As this artist reflects on her career as a musician, she is not a fan of her voice in most of <a href=#>her previous songs</a>. She does not feel like it is representative of who she was or is now. However, this artist is learning to love their voice because she has finally found her element. She is feeling much more comfortable within the rock and roll genre than she did in any other one she tried before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><p>This artist is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not a fan of her voice</a> in her hit song Come and Get It. She says that she can hear how disingenuous she is being because it did not feel like "her song".

He actually avoided hearing it at all costs because he hated it so much. However, he has found a home in his voice now that he is older. It is common for people to grow more comfortable with their voices as they age because they get more familiar with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kurt-cobain><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kurt Cobain</span></h2><p>This legendary alternative rock pioneer actually grew tired of his own voice and developed a hatred for it. He felt like his song, like Smells Like Teen Spirit, were grossly overplayed, and he just could not stand to listen to his own voice anymore.
