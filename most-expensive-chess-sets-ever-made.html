Most regular sets cost somewhere between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$50-$200,</a> depending on how they’re made.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>But some people covet much more luxurious chess sets that have unique designs and are made from expensive materials — even gemstones!</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>You may be wondering what some of these extravagant sets look like and how much they cost. So, what are the 10 most expensive chess sets ever made?</p><h2 id=h-10-the-gem-set-gold-chess-set-187-500 data-injectable=false>10.

Not sure what to spend it on? Consider the Gem Set Gold chess set.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Considered to have originated from South India between 1775-1825, this set contains pieces with sparkling rubies and beautiful emeralds carefully embedded into the figures.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>There is also a delicate script on the base of its pieces that is hard to decipher, but some experts believe it’s in a language similar to Telugu. Both the gems’ positioning and inscriptions indicate the chess set’s South Indian origins. But why is it so expensive?</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>The inscription gives it historical value, and the rubies and emeralds are costly, as well. In addition, the base of each piece is set in gold.

The artist who made it, Man Ray, was a famous surrealist and Dadaist painter and photographer — and he made this chess set.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>This set is coveted for its sleek look, wooden mounting, and storage drawers that were created to protect the chess pieces when they’re not being used.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>While it’s not hard to find reproductions of Man Ray’s sets that cost less, this particular set has been confirmed authentic by experts. it even has the artist’s name inscribed on the board, which makes it a valuable art piece.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>The condition of this set is excellent; its chess pieces are made of polished bronze, and it has a brass inlay and enamel board mounted in wood.</p><h2 id=h-8-mother-of-pearl-and-tortoiseshell-chess-set-214-500 data-injectable=false>8.

Made circa 1870, the owls are stained with a deep brown shade, and some of the pawns have glass eyes to indicate wounded warriors.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The details show knights with shields, swords, and plumed helmets, and queens with detailed crowns and robes.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>The German-Carved Ivory Animalier Chess Set&nbsp;is costly because of its excellent condition despite its old age, unusual design, and expensive materials.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>It has coromandel veneering and a satinwood casket with a carefully crafted brass lock plate.</p><h2 id=h-5-marcel-duchamp-pocket-chess-set-423-000 data-injectable=false>5.

Before cell phones, this was the best set for players who were on the move.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>So, leather and pins are not expensive materials like some of these other sets have. There’s no gold or silver here. The price is so high strictly because of Marcel Duchamp, who signed and dated the set, increasing its worth.</p><h2 id=h-4-the-christian-i-von-munch-chess-set-552-570 data-injectable=false>4.
