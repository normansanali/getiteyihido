Kevin McAllister was just trying to have a nice time without his mean family, and while he enjoyed eating ice cream any time of day that he wanted, he realized that some men wanted to break into his house and steal all of his family's stuff. That definitely put a damper on the holiday in Home Alone. <a href=#>Chris Columbus has a great Joe Pesci story</a>, which is really fun to hear about since fans can never get enough of watching Kevin go after Marv and Harry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it was interesting watching <a href=#>the new Home Alone movie</a>, of course, nothing is like the original movie, and Daniel Stern did an incredible job playing Marv. Daniel Stern went on to have an amazing career after his famous Christmas movie. Keep reading to find out what Daniel Stern has been up to since Home Alone.</p><h2 id=daniel-stern-39-s-career-after-39-home-alone-39>Daniel Stern's Career After 'Home Alone'</h2><p>The <a href=#>Home Alone house is famous</a> and Marv and Harry tried so hard to get in there, but Kevin had traps for them at every possible entry point.</p><p>After Home Alone, Daniel Stern kept acting a lot. Daniel starred in the 1991 movie City Slickers, which is one of his most famous roles. Some of Daniel Stern's other movies include 2001's Viva La Nowhere, 2009's Whip It, and 2010's The Last Three Days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the actor is always going to be asked about Home Alone. In an interview with The A.V. Club, <a href=#>Daniel Stern talked about his movie roles</a>, and he said, "Well, what can you say about Marv and Harry that has not been said? The humanity, the subtlety of those characters is beyond compare of anything that I think has ever been performed on the film."</p><p>Daniel said "We just were cartoony" and it was a really enjoyable experience making the movie with Joe Pesci.</p><p>Daniel also talked about the 1996 movie Celtic Pride and said "that was one of the best movies I ever did" although he didn't ever sit down and see the whole film. Colin Quinn and Judd Apatow wrote the screenplay and Daniel Stern played Mike O'Hara who is best pals with fellow Celtics fan Jimmy Flaherty (played by Dan Aykroyd). Mike and Jimmy come up with a plan that, of course, is a terrible idea: give Lewis Scott, the star of the team who plays against the Celtics, a lot to drink so he can't play at his best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Macaulay Culkin Made Millions From 'Home Alone 2: Lost In New York'</a></span></p><h2 id=daniel-stern-became-an-artist-and-has-3-kids>Daniel Stern Became An Artist And Has 3 Kids</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Stern also works as a sculptor</a>, and in an interview with The Malibu Times, he said that he had fun making art when he was a kid and this is something that has lasted since then.</p><p>Daniel Stern had a super poetic way to describe making his art: he said, “I am a storyteller at heart and my sculptural work allows me to give a literal and visceral dimension to my characters. Much like taking a still frame from a film, the work communicates freeing, fleeting or reflexive moments from my character's varied narratives.”</p><p>SF Gate reported that Daniel created a sculpture and gave it to Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. Daniel shares more information about his sculptures on his website and has work that is "life-sized" and also smaller, meant for "tabletops" and "home and garden." His work is really interesting and he also has a "one of a kind" section for some offbeat sculptures that don't fit into any easy categories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daniel Stern and Laure Mattos got married in 1980 and have three kids: 39-year-old-senator Henry Stern, 32-year-old Ella Marie Stern, and 35-year-old Sophie Stern.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Major Thing Macaulay Culkin Has Done Since 'Home Alone'</a></span></p><h2 id=playing-marv-in-39-home-alone-39>Playing Marv In 'Home Alone'</h2><p>'90s kids remember every single prank that Kevin played on the Wet Bandits, and it's fun to hear about the filming experience from Daniel Stern's perspective.</p><p>Daniel Stern mentioned the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tarantula scene in Home Alone</a> in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter and said that there was an actual tarantula on set, along with one made of rubber. This would make anyone nervous, of course, and he explained that "everyone seemed cool with it" and he went along with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Marv yelled, that was because Daniel was really freaked out about the whole thing.
