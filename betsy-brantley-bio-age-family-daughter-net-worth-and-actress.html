A cat already in residence was less than thrilled with the newcomer.</p><p>The standoff set the stage for actress Betsy Brantley and her teenage daughter, Sarah Soderbergh, who paid a well-timed visit. Blueberry curled up on a delighted Sarah’s shoulder and promptly fell asleep—and soon the kitten had a new home free of rivals. That was about 12 years ago. These days, Blueberry lives with Brantley in a pre-Civil War era home in the Montford area.</p><p>(Sarah, all grown up, is in Seattle.) With her moss-green gaze and broad nose, Blueberry is a study in feline nobility. Asked to describe the kitty’s personality, a beaming Brantley said, “She’s a cat who thinks she’s a dog—and then she remembers she’s a cat.</p><p>” Translation: the kitty is extremely easygoing and not a picky eater, but if you heard her “huge purr” when she curls up in front of the fireplace or hops aboard Brantley’s shoulder, you would know she is 100 percent happy cat. Pictured here, Betsy Brantley enjoys a cozy afternoon at home with her beloved cat, Blueberry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fl7K1v9hmmauZnqm5psWMm6CoZZGcsm6ywKagpbFdma62s8etnKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGjsW6twq2pnqujZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbetsy-brantley-bio-age-family-daughter-net-worth-and-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbetsy-brantley-bio-age-family-daughter-net-worth-and-actress.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbetsy-brantley-bio-age-family-daughter-net-worth-and-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbetsy-brantley-bio-age-family-daughter-net-worth-and-actress.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbetsy-brantley-bio-age-family-daughter-net-worth-and-actress.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbetsy-brantley-bio-age-family-daughter-net-worth-and-actress.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charles-e-blake-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charles-e-blake-net-worth.html>Charles E.
