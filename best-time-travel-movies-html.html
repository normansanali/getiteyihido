As Mark Duplass’s forlorn character says in Safety Not Guaranteed, “The mission has to do with regret.” With all the potential to explore the unknown world of the future, so often when our minds conspire to bend the rules of time it’s instead to rehash the old. It’s compelling to watch a character in a movie do what we cannot — right past wrongs or uncover the reason for or meaning behind the events in their lives, whether they be emotionally catastrophic or merely geopolitically motivated.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qk3l00173f6njt29jhu0@published data-word-count=88>So absent is the future from the canon, in fact, that when it is involved, typically future dwellers are leaving their own time to come back to the present. Back to the Future Part II aside, it seems as if there’s something about going forward in time that just doesn’t track for humans. (Of course, you could argue that this is because the present-day concept of bidirectional time travel would infinitely multiply or change beyond recognition any future that may occur, but that’s a knot for another article.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qk6p00183f6nd1w9f7nw@published data-word-count=109>In any case, the time-travel stories deemed worthy of Hollywood budgets aren’t always straightforward in their mechanics. Some films on this list barely qualify as time-travel movies at all; others could hardly qualify as anything else. There are movies about trips through time but also ones about the bending and fracturing and muddying thereof; then there are those about, as Andy Samberg aptly puts it in Palm Springs, “one of those infinite time-loop situations you might have heard about.” There’s even a movie in which we get only 13 seconds’ worth of time travel, when it functions more like a joke whose punch line hits at the film’s climax.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qkae00193f6n9n9nmaph@published data-word-count=143>What these films all do have in common is a fascination with changing the way time works. That being said, the list leaves out movies in larger, more extended franchises in which time meddling is a one-off dalliance thrown into a sequel with little by way of foreshadowing: think Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Avengers: Endgame, and Men in Black III. (It also leaves off perhaps the Ur-time-travel movie, Primer, and the quite good Midnight in Paris because their directors don’t deserve the column inches.) We’re looking at self-contained stories using time mechanics from the start, with preference given to those that involve themselves more intently with the ins and outs of time travel; that ask questions about time, aging, memory and so forth; and that try to succeed at it in new and interesting ways. So let’s get to it.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy8s4kw00233f6nkyjqg2ow@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>25. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Galaxy Quest" href=#>Galaxy Quest</a> (1999)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qkgn001a3f6nqyfvkca7@published data-word-count=132>Does Galaxy Quest really count as a time-travel movie? Some compelling reasons argue that it doesn’t: Time travel isn’t a major factor in the plot, and the time traveling that does occur is, yes, only a 13-second jump. But its use of time travel is meaningful insofar as the movie itself is a loving spoof of Star Trek, which makes use of time travel in three films (<a href=#>one of which made this list</a>), not to mention dozens of episodes across its various TV iterations. Tacking on time travel as a deus ex machina for the actors in a Star Trek–like show pressed into service as an actual space crew by an endangered alien race is the exact right amount of ribbing in a movie that’s as on point as it is hilarious.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy9np14007l3f6nw7tb6ogi@published data-word-count=8><strong>Galaxy Quest is available to rent on </strong><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy8t7ed002u3f6n6c6wfjnd@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>24. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Happy Death Day" href=#>Happy Death Day</a> (2017)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qkv6001b3f6n5qcwolxg@published data-word-count=114>Pick away at the surface of a time-loop movie and you find a horror movie. Most of the entries on this list are covered in enough feel-good spin to land as comedies, but Happy Death Day stares the horror of the time-loop phenomenon right in the face. (It’s also quite funny.) Reliving the same day over and over is an unimaginably potent form of psychological torture, and adding murder to the equation does little to dull that edge. The film follows a college-age protagonist struggling to escape from a masked slasher hell-bent on killing her again and again while she tries to solve the mystery of how she got stuck in a time loop.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy9owj1007t3f6njwcive2x@published data-word-count=9><strong>Happy Death Day is available to rent on </strong><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy8ureg00303f6nd2gnqryn@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>23. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Back to the Future Part II" href=#>Back to the Future Part II</a> (1989)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8ql20001c3f6nykan0oab@published data-word-count=103>Seriously, this may be the only good movie in which the film’s whole focus is using a time machine to travel into the future.

Produced by Spike Lee and featuring one of filmdom’s most famous time travelers in a cameo role, it follows a Black teenage science prodigy who uses a time machine to try to save her brother from being killed by a police officer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy9r9dp00893f6nka40ybhc@published data-word-count=7><strong>See You Yesterday is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy8wpdl003c3f6n9lf2sfyr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>21. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure" href=#>Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure</a> (1989)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8ql67001e3f6n9ehldvp3@published data-word-count=106>No offense to the Back to the Future franchise, but time travel never looks more fun on film than it does in the first Bill & Ted movie. It’s a concept that feels distinctly of a different era, so pure is its zaniness, that it’s hard to imagine anyone concocting it today. The titular duo, Californian high-school students in the ’80s, travel through the past looking for historical figures in order to ace a history project, then bring them all back to the present.

That’s in no small part due to director Terry Gilliam getting the best out of Bruce Willis and a young Brad Pitt, and recasting World War III as a planet-decimating virus.

Rather, it’s a sort of de facto time-loop scenario in which the protagonist tries repeatedly to pay a ransom to save her boyfriend’s life. In fact, if not for a few key details, it could easily be characterized (and often has been) as an alternate-endings movie rather than a time-travel film. But the fact that Lola seems to be learning from her past attempts with each successive one suggests that she is, indeed, using knowledge gained from previous loops to bring a satisfactory end to this situation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy9vjvh008t3f6ngb9k5qz5@published data-word-count=9><strong>Run Lola Run is available to rent on </strong><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy90hsb00403f6nhxk3j98g@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>17. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Edge of Tomorrow" href=#>Edge of Tomorrow</a> (2014)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qlgp001i3f6n7m5bc41m@published data-word-count=131>One of the most striking things about <a href=#>Groundhog Day</a> is the mutability and replicability of its core conceit. Perhaps the best case in point is Edge of Tomorrow, sometimes known as Live. Die. Repeat. after its original tagline. It’s the kind of physically grueling movie only an actor as genuinely unhinged as Tom Cruise could pull off. A noncombatant thrust into a war against invading aliens, Cruise’s character finds himself reliving day one of combat over and over, slowly but surely refining his techniques in order to survive the extraterrestrial onslaught. Like the central twosome in the much less violent <a href=#>Palm Springs</a>, he winds up with a partner in (war) crime, teaming up with the similarly time-trapped Emily Blunt, and the explanation for the replay glitch here is actually pretty satisfying.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzya92ua008y3f6nyha30tpx@published data-word-count=8><strong>Edge of Tomorrow is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Fubo TV</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy91grk00463f6njx3a26nq@published><span class=anchor-span id=star-trek></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>16.

Her character on Parks and Recreation, April Ludgate, was, by all accounts, created specifically to channel Plaza’s real-life personality to the screen, and she plays essentially the same character in Safety Not Guaranteed. Here, she’s a sarcastic intern at a magazine working on a story about a would-be time traveler and using her feminine wiles to slowly gain his trust.

The travel isn’t instantaneous: It literally does take them 2,000 years to get there; they’re just unconscious and on life support. Still, the way the film’s ending handles the iconic reveal is exactly in line with the best of the time-travel canon, the telescoping, mise en abyme feeling of the world shifting in front of your very eyes without your moving an inch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyaew9p009y3f6nlihg3bo5@published data-word-count=10><strong>Planet of the Apes is available to rent on </strong><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy967ug00503f6n0kmitzg5@published><span class=anchor-span id=groundhog-day></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>11. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Groundhog Day" href=#>Groundhog Day</a> (1993)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qmck001o3f6n64oe9t7s@published data-word-count=127>The famous Bill Murray vehicle essentially invented the infinite-time-loop genre (and it’s hardly a movie that succeeds on the strength of its concept alone), but the idea at its core is so steeped in the casual misogyny of late-’80s and early-’90s cinema that it’s hard to watch today without cringing. Murray’s character employing what amounts to PUA-style techniques over and over and over in a desperate bid to fuck his hapless co-worker just doesn’t hit the way it did back then. If the story arc didn’t present a guy detoxifying himself of the worst aspects of masculinity in order to be worthy of a woman’s love as the primary way for a 20th-century white man to achieve full personhood, this would be much higher on the list.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyafz1e00a33f6nybqtxipy@published data-word-count=6><strong>Groundhog Day is streaming on </strong><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link><strong>Starz</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy973cc00563f6naxwjcwjx@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>10. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Predestination href=#>Predestination</a> (2014)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qmek001p3f6nowkc7xfh@published data-word-count=89>This is probably the most complicated film on the list. Following a “temporal agent” (played by Ethan Hawke) who’s trying to prevent a bombing in 1970s New York, it’s based on a Robert A. Heinlein short story and features Shiv Roy herself, Sarah Snook, in a star-making turn as someone with a complicated backstory and a secret. Like the best sci-fi, the film’s premise raises all kinds of fascinating questions about the titular concept and throws in some interesting musings on sex, gender, and the self in the process.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyagvvj00a83f6narw9ztma@published data-word-count=5><strong>Predestination is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Tubi</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy98uil005c3f6nucmrqhyq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>9. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Looper href=#>Looper</a> (2012)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qmg0001q3f6nkqo9ggk9@published data-word-count=153>Wes Anderson gets a lot of flak for his overwrought twee visuals, but Rian Johnson has a knack for making movies that feel and function like dioramas even if they don’t look it. Narratively speaking, everything here is constructed just so — and there’s a certain beauty in that — but who ever had a profound experience of art by looking at a diorama? Looper was probably Johnson’s least precious pre–Star Wars film, which is nice because the temptation to drastically overmaneuver the mechanics of a time-travel story can lead to disaster. The tech used to Bruce Willis–ify Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s face is distracting, and the third act’s retreat from the postapocalyptic city of the future to the postapocalyptic corn farm of the future is a brave choice that the film struggles to land. Still, Johnson’s vision of a future in which organized crime runs time travel is compelling and well worth a watch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyahrsu00ad3f6n019ppvf3@published data-word-count=5><strong>Looper is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy99ecw005i3f6n81mt0xt5@published><span class=anchor-span id=donnie-darko></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>8. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Donnie Darko" href=#>Donnie Darko</a> (2001)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qmjd001r3f6nz5vc9olo@published data-word-count=90>Donnie Darko is a bit of a genre mash-up. Part high-school movie, part sci-fi flick, part bleak meditation on the soullessness of late-’80s America, it’s nevertheless a weirdly successful piece of filmmaking that makes fantastic use of a young Jake Gyllenhaal, a great supporting cast (Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, Jena Malone, and Patrick Swayze among others), and an absolutely iconic haunting cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World.” Watching high schoolers navigate parallel universes, wormholes, and time travel is a dicey proposition, but director Richard Kelly makes it work, somehow.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyaiw7t00ai3f6nv34lmxqg@published data-word-count=7><strong>Donnie Darko is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>HBO Max</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy99yha005o3f6n73hhzmi8@published><span class=anchor-span id=back-to-the-future></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>7. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Back to the Future" href=#>Back to the Future</a> (1984)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qmms001s3f6n43t5i13w@published data-word-count=122>While it’s clearly superior to the sequel (and leagues ahead of the final film in the trilogy), the original Back to the Future is a bit of a mess (John Mulaney <a href=#>was right</a>, to be honest). Its racial and gender politics are cringey, and the incest subplot is weird (“It’s your cousin Marvin. Marvin Pornhub. You know that new plot element you’ve been looking for?”), but there’s a clear interest in time travel beyond its shimmering surface: the very real addressing of the “grandfather problem” in time travel via the slow disappearance of Marty from his family photo, the accidental invention of rock music, and a genuine curiosity about the nuts-and-bolts mechanics of time machines. Ahh, what the hell.

Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg‘s characters, stuck in the loop together, are a perfect comedic match, and their shared humanity makes for a beautiful arc. The film raises questions about what’s worth doing in life when nothing lasts and how to stay sane when every day is the same. Of course, as a sort of polar opposite of Tenet, it benefited from coming out during the pandemic by speaking, as it does, to the experience of lockdown.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyamq6n00ax3f6n92yqgjx6@published data-word-count=6><strong>Palm Springs is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Hulu</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy9bsa000603f6na7zmdstm@published><span class=anchor-span id=tenet></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>5. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Tenet href=#>Tenet</a> (2020)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qms9001u3f6n4221hyih@published data-word-count=148><a href=#>Interstellar</a> wasn’t enough for Chris Nolan, apparently. Tenet’s legacy may end up being little more than that of the COVID action movie no one saw — a bloated thriller that Nolan fought to get into theaters and bar from home viewing reportedly to swell the size of his own pockets. It really did suffer from bad timing, though, because this is genuinely a quintessential big-screen popcorn movie whose absurdity is all the more palatable when it’s given the audiovisual bombast it deserves. Ambitious in scope as it traces a war on the past by the future (yes, you read that right), Tenet is as enamored of action tropes as it is in bucking them, and its investment in rendering visible the brain-bendingly knotty mechanics of moving through time is laudable, even when the movie itself remains opaque — as impenetrable as the future, as hazy as the past.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyanaor00b23f6nq6rwkxxi@published data-word-count=6><strong>Tenet is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>HBO Max</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy9chwm00663f6nlxkd4tfe@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>4. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Terminator" href=#>The Terminator</a> (1984)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qmut001v3f6no1ikzvql@published data-word-count=110>A partner to Blade Runner in the mid-’80s invention of sci-fi noir, The Terminator is a stunning film in many ways, despite the third act’s now-iffy visual effects. While it’s not James Cameron’s debut, and it would go on to be bested by <a href=#>its sequel</a>, it functions as an incredible showcase for an emerging young director who would exclusively make big stories for the rest of his career.

But in Interstellar, a Nolan movie in its titular ambitions, there’s a core element of time travel wrought not as sci-fi fireworks but as a paean to the sheer force and will of the power of love. It both does and doesn’t work, depending on your capacity for cheese in space, but even besides that, Nolan’s use of time as story arc — the way Miller’s planet functions, in particular — is conceptually masterful in the best kind of time-travel-movie way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyap2pt00bc3f6ndbzorn3e@published data-word-count=5><strong>Interstellar is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Paramount+</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy anchored" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy9dxzo006q3f6nsem4nhml@published><span class=anchor-span id=t2></span> <span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>2. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Terminator 2: Judgment Day" href=#>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a> (1991)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qn5a001x3f6njdhzdam8@published data-word-count=157>Whereas the franchise’s first movie spends more time on the question of time travel, in the second it takes a bit of a back seat to the action itself. It’s hard to fault director James Cameron for this decision; T2 remains one of the best action movies of the ’90s and — along with Jurassic Park and The Matrix — one of the decade’s best when for special effects. The groundbreaking T-1000 would honestly be enough to get this movie on the list; a tween John Connor grappling with questions of predestination and the fact that he is vicariously responsible for his own conception feel almost like icing on the time-travel cake. Much as in <a href=#>12 Monkeys</a>, time travel here is mistaken for delusion, as valiant Sarah Connor, in a Cassandra-esque nightmare, has to battle against the future only she knows is coming. Of course, Cassandra never had access to any firepower stored in underground desert arsenals.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyapypi00bh3f6n9nu8hsrh@published data-word-count=8><strong>Terminator 2: Judgment Day is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckzy9ekvb006w3f6nu0hqu889@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>1. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Arrival href=#>Arrival</a> (2016)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzy8qn7g001y3f6nyh0kv220@published data-word-count=194>It’s fair to wonder whether Arrival really is, in fact, a time-travel movie. The Ted Chiang short story it’s based on isn’t about time travel per se; rather, it’s an exploration of alternate forms of temporal understanding. The linguist protagonist, played by Amy Adams, doesn’t travel through time so much as come to experience it differently. Still, the plot ends up hinging on foreknowledge that she is granted not via visions but by actually experiencing her future simultaneously with her present and past. For our purposes, though, that’s time fuckery enough to merit inclusion, and boy howdy does the film deliver in overall quality. Partly, that’s simply a question of the source material. Chiang is arguably the most talented (and possibly the most decorated) American sci-fi writer of his generation. But the source story is not especially Hollywood friendly, and director Denis Villeneuve has adopted it lovingly, borrowing a plot device from another of Chiang’s stories, the more straightforwardly time-travel-based “The Merchant and the Alchemist’s Gate,” in order to add some third-act blockbuster flavor. The result is a beautiful meditation on love, choice, and courage that packs art-film ethos into a genuine sci-fi blockbuster.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckzyarofc00br3f6ngaozjd3t@published data-word-count=7><strong>Arrival is streaming on </strong><a href=#><strong>Hulu </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a href=#><strong>Paramount+</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjrmbqw4i0092msyel7uxm37n@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>From Groundhog Day to Russian Doll, the Inescapable Power of the Time Loop</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The 25 Greatest Time-Travel Movies Ever Made</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZK2hnZp6tb7Ar5ylZZ2kw6qx0mefraWc</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-time-travel-movies-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-time-travel-movies-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-time-travel-movies-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-time-travel-movies-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-time-travel-movies-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-time-travel-movies-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-sofas-buying-guide-top-trends.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-sofas-buying-guide-top-trends.html>Ultimate best sofas guide for 2024: The top trends, sofas and brands this year</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./susan-crow.html>Susan Crow- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage, Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./susan-crow.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
