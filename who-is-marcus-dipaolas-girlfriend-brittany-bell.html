She is an animal rescuer whose videos can be found on DiPaola's YouTube channel.</p><p>The video of him introducing his girlfriend spawned a wave of duets that resulted in the creation of multiple duets on TikTok.</p><p>TikTok's most notable feature is its community of creatively funny people. TikTok is the only social platform that allows anyone to take someone else's video and use it to create their own unique story.&nbsp;Marcus uploaded a new TikTok on May 4th, 2021, Star Wars Day, introducing his girlfriend to his large followers. It's a fairly normal video, but TikTok has its mind.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/10/1a484393-1fff-4ce6-b101-341cbcf9c53c.webp></p><p>One of the top commenters on the original video thought Brittany looked terrified, as if she were being held, hostage.</p><p>This sparked a new duet trend in which people added their contributions to make it appear as if there was a hostage situation in Marcus's room.&nbsp;When a dueter took a Nerf gun and pointed it at Brittany's head, it was the initial video to flourish the idea of a hostage situation.</p><a title=@b8esportsgg href=#>@b8esportsgg</a> @marcus.dipaola #<a title=dendipudge href=#>dendipudge </a>#<a title=esport href=#>esport </a>#<a title=acid href=#>acid</a> <a title="♬ original sound - B8 Esports" href=#>♬ original sound - B8 Esports</a><p>This video marked the start of something much bigger than just that one duet. It quickly progressed to more random but amusing duet contributions, such as adding limbs that are not visible in the frame.</p><p>The trend has spread across multiple timelines, but they all revolve around the same idea: a hostage situation, and Brittany is in danger. From SWAT teams to people pretending to watch other people's TikToks on their TVs, it quickly grew to have as much lore and offshoots as Star Wars.</p><p>Following the video, he never posted anything related to Brittany and had solely dedicated his account to news purposes.&nbsp;People may often confuse her with Nick Cannon's wife, Brittany Bell, but they are two different people.</p><p>The Masked Singer host, 41, and Bell welcomed their third child, Cannon's tenth child, in September 2022.</p><h2 id=does-marcus-dipaola-have->What Disability Does Marcus DiPaola Have?</h2><p>Netizens were confused that Marcus DiPaola had learning disabilities.</p><p>But he doesn't, in fact, he once mentioned in a tweet that he writes for middle school students with learning disabilities.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/10/c61002e6-ed39-4493-aa6c-51b0cfbec78e.webp></p><p>While some <a href=# rel=noopener>people</a> find it amusing that he reports the middle schoolers with disabilities, before turning around and telling those middle schoolers how many women he boinks at the same time.</p><p>Some people are praising him for his work.</p><h2 id=marcus-dipaolas-net-worth>Marcus DiPaola's Net Worth, How Rich Is The American TikToker?</h2><p>Marcus DiPaola is an American TikToker who has a net worth of <strong>$1 million.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sportskeeda</a> reported Dipaola could earn up to $2,000 per post on TikTok, besides the brand-sponsored deals.</p><p>On Instagram, he could earn up to $5,000 for a brand-sponsored post. His average earnings on YouTube are around $2,000 per video, excluding brand-sponsored deals, for which he could charge up to $5,000 per video.</p><p>He also earns passive income from royalties on footage shot over the last 11 years of his life that major newspapers, TV networks, Hollywood films, and advertisers purchase to use without attribution.

"I want to be the bridge between mainstream media and teenagers," DiPaola told the Washington Post.</p><p>On election night in October 2020, he began posting on TikTok.
