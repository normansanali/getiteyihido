<time>28 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Marlen Pizzo famously known as <strong>Marlen P.,</strong> is an American native who is gaining fame and Luxury after getting into relation with one of the highest-earning NBA player <strong>Anthony Davis</strong>. Her boyfriend Anthony played from power forward and started to play in the NBA since 2012. Currently, he is with NBA giants <i>Los Angles Lakers</i> and ranked among the list of most valuable players similarly like former NBA star <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Lin</strong></a>.</p><p>Marlen was raised in the United States, but her father came from the Dominican Republic. Marlen, who stayed with her mother in New Orleans, is now staying with Anthony in South Carolina. Furthermore, there are no specifications regarding her early life and birth details.</p><h2>Relationship With Anthony Davis</h2><p>The gorgeous Marlen is widely popular due to her NBA boyfriend, Anthony Davis. Although the love birds have not exchanged their wedding vows, it almost been a more than half-decade of their beautiful relationship. Meanwhile, according to different internet tabloids, they are soon getting<a href=# rel=nofollow> married</a>. But there are no specifications when the lovebirds tie the knot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/SKJBFVF-1587032630348.JPG><p>Moreover, nobody knows exactly when and where these love birds meet for the first time or how they fell in love. For instance, their affair caught the attention of media after the West Coast from Los Angeles. Marlen partner Anthony Davis is extremely private when it comes to his personal life, and has never publicly posted any pictures of his family on social media.</p><p>In a recent interview with <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, Anthony stated that,&nbsp;</p><p>it is apparent that Marlen became a really necessary figure to support my family and while we were in LA she really help out to make things right.</p><p>According to internet tabloids, Marlen P and Anthony Davis perhaps meet in<i> 2015</i>.

After that, the couple split, and after their separation, Britney got married to <strong>Glory Johnson</strong>.</p><h2>How Much Does Marlen Earn?</h2><p>Talking about Marlen's income, then there is no sign of her occupation and profession. Therefore it's a bit hard for us to determine her actual net worth.

Still, the</i> precise sum of compensation as per the contract is not revealed.</p><p>Having a quick-paced rise, Anthony didn't neglect his college. However, he made a <strong>$65,000</strong> donation in conjunction with Boost Mobile to create a new court in his Alma mater high school in Chicago.</p><h2>Branded Cars And Lavish Home</h2><p>Shifting a snapshot into the couple's estate, Anthony maintains a property in Metairie, Louisiana.
