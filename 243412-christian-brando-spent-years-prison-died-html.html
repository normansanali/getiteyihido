Kashfi was infuriated by Marlon's decision to name their son, Christian, after one of his homosexual lovers â€” French actor Christian Marquand.</p><p class=dh>Barely a year after their son was born, the former couple parted ways acrimoniously. Despite their split, the hostility between Marlon and Kashfi continued, with the latter using their son as a tool to take revenge on her ex-husband.</p><p class=dh>Their split set off a lengthy custody battle, which was eventually settled in favor of <a class="me a" href=#>Marlon</a> after it was discovered that the drug-addicted Kashfi had masterminded the kidnap of her then-13-year-old son to northern Mexico.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Christian died in penury, and the family fights that had plagued his tragic life continued long after his death.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d6dde3474e78586dde2a71936339fc9e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Christian Brando during his murder trial on September 26, 1990 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The experience was very traumatic for Christian and took a toll on his mental health. By the time Christian was 16, he was already heavily into drugs and alcohol.</p><p class=dh>After dropping out of high school, Christian bounced between Kalama, Washington, and Los Angeles, where he lived with his dad and regularly found work as a welder and tree trimmer.</p><p class=dh>In 1990, Christian sparked a media firestorm after he shot and killed Dag Drollet, the boyfriend of his pregnant, 20-year-old half-sister, Cheyenne.</p><p class=dh>Despite initially arguing that Drollet was physically abusive to his sister, Christian pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and served six years out of a 10-year prison sentence.

After getting out of Jail, Christian sunk more into his drug addiction and was further traumatized by his father's death in 2004.</p><p class=dh>That same year, Christian married Deborah Presley, but the marriage quickly ended amidst accusations of abuse on both sides.
