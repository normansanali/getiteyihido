<time>04 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Craig McRae, the former Australian footballer’s wife remains a mystery to the public. Get to know more about it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>He has recently been into top searches on Twitter as he has been appointed as senior coach in Collingwood Football Club.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-is-he-married></span>Craig McRae Wife or Partner- Is he Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>McRae has never shared any details about his marriage or his wife. Thus, we can conclude if he is married or not at the moment.</p><p>However, his tweets cannot space the eyes of the public. In 2013, he tweeted how lucky he was to be surrounded by an amazing woman, his mother, partner, and younger daughter. He did not mention if it was his wife or girlfriend.</p><p>But he sure has a daughter. Thus, we can deduce that he has a partner, but her relationship with him needs to be confirmed.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can assume that he prefers to keep his private matters extremely private despite his popularity.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-his-salary-in-collingwood></span>How much is his Salary in Collingwood?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The specific amount of salary he is paid is not known to us yet. However as per some sources, the average salary of a football coach in Australia is AUS$56,000 per year. Thus, we assume he would be paid nearby the same amount during his tenure as senior coach in Collingwood.</p><p>He had a working history in the club. He was assigned as head of development in Collingwood in 2011. He served there for 5 years and later in 2016 moved back to Richmond Club.</p><p>The club is again assigning him to a senior position this time. In addition, it seems his fans and colleagues have supported him as they congratulated him on Twitter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=explore-his-net-worth-as-of-2021></span>Explore his Net Worth as of 2021<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2021, his net worth is estimated to be $1- $5 million. He has been playing football since 1995 and finally retired in 2004. Since then, he has been a trainer in different football clubs.</p><p>During his career as a professional player, he was popular for his ability to kick goals even beyond the fifty-meter line. After he retired as a footballer, he served as a player development coach in the Richmond Football Club.</p><p>He has coached players in Brisbane’s Lion and Collingwood in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 2021, he was with Hawthorn Football Club and recently, a few days ago, he has been appointed as the senior coach in Collingwood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ycqZqhl2K6pL7AnmSwoZaaerC%2BjKmYq6yemr9usdWeqbKsmJ67qHnOp2SnnadisLC4y6KloK%2BfpLFur86amqFn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-everything-on-new-collingwood-coach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-everything-on-new-collingwood-coach.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-everything-on-new-collingwood-coach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-everything-on-new-collingwood-coach.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-everything-on-new-collingwood-coach.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-craig-mcrae-wife-or-partner-everything-on-new-collingwood-coach.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-ebelechukwu-obiano-willie-obiano-wife-slaps-bianca-ojukwu-during-inauguration-program-255592-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-ebelechukwu-obiano-willie-obiano-wife-slaps-bianca-ojukwu-during-inauguration-program-255592-html.html>Who Is Ebelechukwu Obiano?
