However, certain words are better left unsaid when it comes to specific groups. For instance, some <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>vintage slang words</a> like "Daddy-O" would just sound funny when used by someone from a younger generation now. And the opposite seems to be true, as well. According to one language expert, there is one word that older people should never say: "rad."</p><p>"The worst word [you can use] depends on your age bracket," <strong>Fern L. Johnson</strong>, PhD, linguist and professor at Clark University, explains. "When older people use words like 'rad,' they sound like wannabe young people."</p><p>Johnson says when using younger-skewing words, older people are actually aging themselves instead of making themselves seem younger. She says that this word choice is a sign that someone is "trying too hard to sound youthful."</p><p>"There's a certain sense of ownership that younger people feel about 'rad' because it signifies superlative quality and authenticity," she says. "It's an expression that belongs to their generation."</p><p>Johnson says it all has to do with understanding <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>what language is significant to different generations</a>. For instance, she says that she could "tell a student that her presentation in seminar was 'awesome,'" but that it would be weird for her to say that it was 'rad.' That's because the word&nbsp;"sticks out and sounds awkward when the speaker isn't generationally correct," she explains.</p><p>And while Johnson says that technically, any person can use the word "rad," "speaking freely might not reflect well on a speaker" if they aren't taking into account these unspoken formalities of language.</p><p>"Perhaps the best advice is to think twice about using any word or expression that you think is up-to-date and will therefore convey that you are up-to-date," she says. "What might the person who is more authentically linked to an expression think about your using it? Instead of saying, 'That's rad' you could say, 'you [your generation] would call that rad.'"</p><p>If you're curious about what other words might age you, read on.

The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>word has been around for a long time</a>, but its current usage taps into the meaning of being aware of injustice and racism," she explains. So, if an older person is using the word to signify that they are "up with the current cultural trends," and not in conjunction with its updated racial justice connotation, then it is a word that clearly ages them.

This is evident by the popular Twitter account @BrandsSayingBae, which calls out <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>brands using youthful slang on social media</a> as an attempt to attract a younger audience. And trust us, kids can tell when the person tweeting this slang is much too old to be using it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/grandmother-talking-to-granddaughter.jpg><p>"Snatched" is another word Johnson says may have been around for some time, but has changed meaning with the younger crowd. According to Merriam-Webster, the word has been around since the 1500s, typically <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>describing something that was taken with haste</a>. But now, younger generations mean it as a compliment for someone being attractive of well-styled, saying they look "snatched."

She notes that "sick" is "meant to connote something wonderful," but it only comes across as such if said by someone in the younger generation that gave it that meaning.
