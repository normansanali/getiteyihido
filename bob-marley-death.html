He was urged to have his toe amputated when the cancer was diagnosed, but he declined since his Rastafarian beliefs view removing a portion of the body’s “temple” as sinful. He did agree to a skin graft, but by the summer of 1980, the disease had already spread over his entire body.</p><h2 dir=auto>The Legacy of Bob Marley and His Impact on Music</h2><p></p><p dir=auto data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bob Marley is one of the most influential musicians of all time.

When the treatment didn’t work after eight months, Marley flew back to Jamaica. As his condition deteriorated during the flight, he was sent to the hospital when he arrived in Miami, where he passed away on May 11, 1981.</p><h2>Where was the funeral for Marley?</h2><p>On May 21, Bob received a state funeral in Jamaica, with Prime Minister Edward Seaga delivering the eulogy. He was laid to rest alongside his Gibson Les Paul guitar at a chapel near his birthplace.</p><h2>Are there any rumors of foul play surrounding Bob Marley’s passing?</h2><p>The prevailing hypothesis holds that the CIA assassinated Bob Marley because of his rising political profile in Jamaica. They may have planned the attempted murder at Hope Road and turned to more shady methods of sending him off after failing to get him. According to legend, Carl Colby, the late William Colby’s son and current CIA director, later sent Marley a pair of boots. When Bob tried them on, a radioactive copper wire punctured his toe, resulting in cancer. Additionally, there are rumors that Issels was a former SS agent who collaborated with the CIA to assassinate Marley.</p><h2>What final words did Bob Marley utter?</h2><p><strong>You can’t buy life with money. Bob Marley had only one thought in his head as he was taken to a hospital in Miami: his kids.</strong></p><p>Bob’s widow, Rita Marley, has recounted her husband repeating those words as he passed out in interviews and books at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, on May 11, 1981.</p><p>Therefore, you had better acquire the skills necessary to live well.
