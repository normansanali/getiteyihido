You're also less likely to have gynecological problems, like uterine fibroids, which often become more problematic over time.<h2>Is it younger to have a baby at 23?</h2>For others, the question came down to something else entirely: fertility. “Too many women are leaving it later and later and then have problems conceiving,” declared one commentator. “Twenty-three is actually a perfect age to have a child if you can afford it.”<h2>Is 24 a good age to get married?</h2>It could make you happier.<p>What's more, the largest number of women who described their marriage as "very happy" tied the knot when they were 24 to 26.
