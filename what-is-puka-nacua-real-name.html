The pronunciation of his name is "POO-kuh, Nuh-KOO-uh". Coming from a Polynesian background, Nacua's mother and grandmother immigrated to the United States from West Samoa. This cultural heritage has influenced his upbringing and his journey to becoming an NFL player.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite being drafted in the fifth round of the NFL draft, Nacua has become a breakout star in the 2023 season. He has quickly emerged as the top target for Rams' quarterback Matt Stafford, especially with star receiver Cooper Kupp sidelined. Nacua's impact on the field has been remarkable, setting the NFL record for most catches by a rookie in their first two games. He has also recorded over 100 receiving yards in each game, showcasing his talent and potential.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Nacua's success can be attributed to his dedication, hard work, and the support of his family. He credits his family's support for helping him overcome hardships and maintain a strong work ethic. His father passed away when he was young, and this loss has shaped his perspective on life. Nacua draws inspiration from those he has lost and uses mantras, including one borrowed from the movie Cars, to remind himself of the gift of being alive.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the memorable moments in Nacua's young NFL career was his first touchdown, which came in a game-winning catch in overtime. This moment holds a special place in his heart, and he considers it a story he will tell his children. It showcases his ability to perform under pressure and contribute to his team's success.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Nacua's rise in the NFL has been nothing short of impressive. Despite doubts about his speed and playing time in college, he has proven himself to be one of the brightest young stars in the league. Currently, he leads the NFL in receptions and is second in receiving yards. His exceptional performance on the field has earned him recognition and admiration from fans and experts alike.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Puka Nacua's real name is Makea, but he is commonly known by his nickname "Puka."
