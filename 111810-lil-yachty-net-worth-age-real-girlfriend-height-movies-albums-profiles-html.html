However, things did not go very well for Miles while in school; he was teased and bullied by friends for being <i>different</i>.

He would couch surf at friends' houses, but New York is expensive, and he ran out of money. His best option at the time was to go to college, and he attended Alabama State University.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, college proved to be another hurdle because he felt misunderstood and disliked by everybody. So he would lock himself up in his room and concentrate on writing music. Eventually, he dropped out after 2 months, and this turned out to be a fantastic choice because he became a viral hit soon after.</p><h2>Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e0a8ddc4214fc545.jpg><p class=align-left>Lil Yachty first went viral in December 2015 after one of his songs; <i>One night, </i>was used in a <a href=#>viral </a>comedy skit.
