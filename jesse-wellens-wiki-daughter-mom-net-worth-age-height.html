She had suffered from depression for over ten years and used drugs while on drugs.&nbsp;Stella was also suicidal and had been put into a coma after an unsuccessful suicide attempt.</span></p><p><span>A few weeks before his death, Jesse’s mother had been declared missing.&nbsp;Jesse expressed his fears that his mother was suicidal since his grandmother had just passed away a few weeks earlier.</span></p><p><span>Jesse was right about his fears… Local authorities would later discover Stella’s body in her car parked in a business parking lot.&nbsp;She was laid to rest later in December 2015.</span></p><h2><span>Daughter</span></h2><p><span>During the same week that Jesse announced his shocking split from his girlfriend of over a decade, he also shocked fans by announcing that he had a baby he had given up for adoption.</span></p><p><span>Also Read: Jake Paul Married, Wife, Girlfriend, Brother, Height, House, Arrest</span></p><p><span>In a series of tweets, Jesse explained that he wanted her back.&nbsp;However, many speculated that it was just one of his usual pranks, but Jesse claimed he was serious.</span></p><p><span>While many seemed to sympathize with him, others criticized him for revealing information on social media.&nbsp;One user @Jessewelle wrote: “You need to take a step back and understand what you want before posting all of this on social media.&nbsp;You are an adult, act like one.&nbsp;“</span></p><p><span>Jesse deleted several of his tweets, but kept the one where he mentioned the child’s name and age.&nbsp;Her name is Luchia and she is 13 years old in 2016.</span></p><p><span>In an effort to join her, Wellens moved to New York, where Luchia lives with the parents who adopted her.</span></p><h2><span>Net worth: $5 million</span></h2><h2><span>Height: 5 feet 11 inches</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiilajApnnWnqOlnZ6oeri1yqJknZmlnLW1sdFmpKilXaOytXnWqKmtoF2WtKZ5x56goKCkZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjesse-wellens-wiki-daughter-mom-net-worth-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjesse-wellens-wiki-daughter-mom-net-worth-age-height.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjesse-wellens-wiki-daughter-mom-net-worth-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjesse-wellens-wiki-daughter-mom-net-worth-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjesse-wellens-wiki-daughter-mom-net-worth-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjesse-wellens-wiki-daughter-mom-net-worth-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jiri-prochazka.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jiri-prochazka.html>Jir Prochzka Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-complete-the-cursed-mermaid-in-shin-megami-tensei-v.html>How to complete The Cursed Mermaid in Shin Megami Tensei V</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-complete-the-cursed-mermaid-in-shin-megami-tensei-v.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
