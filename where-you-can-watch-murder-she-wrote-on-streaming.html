The Academy Award recipient, who was made a Dame Commander by Queen Elizabeth II in 2014, can be rightly described as Dame Entertainment.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Her movie career stretched from Gaslight alongside Ingrid Bergman in 1944 to playing herself in the Knives Out sequel Glass Onion, set to release at the end of 2023. She was famous for her musical roles, on stage and screen, including Disney classics Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Beauty and the Beast.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>But what many people will remember her for is her role as Jessica Fletcher in the long-running and highly influential crime drama Murder She Wrote.</p><h2 id=h-murder-she-wrote data-injectable=false><strong>Murder She Wrote</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/murder-she-wrote.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Murder She Wrote premiered on September 30, 1984, on CBS, and no one expected it would still be pulling in significant ratings 12 years later. The show amassed 12 seasons of 265 episodes. After those ended in 2003, Lansbury kept Fletcher sleuthing across four TV movies until 2007.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Fletcher wasn’t the first protagonist of a crime drama who inspired some wry jokes that her presence alone was enough to trigger a murder, and she should be on an FBI watch list at least. But the twist in Murder She Wrote was in the series’ punning name. Fletcher wasn’t a detective on the books like Columbo or consulting like Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes — she was an amateur sleuth who also happened to be a well-connected best-selling writer of mysteries.</p><p data-characters=708 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>Fletcher was based in the fictional Maine town of Cabot Cove for much of the series, a part of North America perhaps more famous to literary fans for Stephen King’s brand of horror. But Lansbury, as the retired English teacher with her feet on the ground, was an endlessly comforting presence as the show wracked up hundreds of deaths. She also enjoyed a far more friendly relationship with law enforcement around America, and occasionally the world, than many of her peers. Most, if not all, valued the author’s perceptive qualities. By later seasons, Fletcher had convinced enough of them she knew what she was talking about she’d started teaching criminology and spending more time in New York City.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>The endlessly watchable Lansbury was a massive part of the show’s success, but she wasn’t always in mind to play the iconic writer. The producers developed the concept for Jean Stapleton. When the actress turned the project down, its future was in doubt until Lansbury — a recent big-screen Miss Marple — surprised them by not only being interested in a continuing TV series but seeing the potential of Jessica Fletcher. She was right: the sleuth became Lansbury’s best-loved and longest-running role.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>A dominating force on weekend TV for most of the 1980s, at its peak, Jessica Fletcher’s crime solving pulled in more than 30 million viewers every week. Guest stars frequently returned, often in different roles, and the show even landed a high-profile crossover with Tom Selleck’s crime drama Magnum P.I. The Murder She Wrote franchise has branched out into a point-and-click video game and a spin-off set of novels that are still being published.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, the series is still popular on streaming worldwide, but where can you watch it online?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Where can you watch Murder She Wrote online?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Angela-Lansbury-as-Jessica-Fletcher-murder-she-wrote-18910812-640-480.jpg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>If you’re itching to hear that catchy theme tune and hear Jessica Fletcher start every episode with “Tonight on Murder, She Wrote…” you’re in luck: you can stream all 12 seasons on Peacock right now with a subscription.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>The show is also available through the Roku channel and on fuboTV and Philo with subscriptions to those networks.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>All series of the show are also available on Amazon Prime.
