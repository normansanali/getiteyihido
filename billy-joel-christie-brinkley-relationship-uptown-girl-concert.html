As a result of his years of success, Joel has continued to cash in on his many beloved songs decades after they were released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One example of a way that Joel continues to make money off his music in 2024 is that he is still paid a fortune to perform in concert. Since Joel has always continued performing, his ongoing success typically isn't noteworthy. However, one of Joel's 2024 concerts led to a truly newsworthy moment.</p><p>In April 2024, Joel performed a concert at New York's Madison Square Garden. During his performance, a full-circle moment took place in front of the crowd. When Joel performed his beloved song "Uptown Girl", <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">footage of his ex-wife Christie Brinkley dancing to the song</a></strong> in the audience could be seen on huge screens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/billy-joel-hard-rock-live-seminole.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone unfamiliar with Joel and Brinkley's history, it may not be clear why her dancing to "Uptown Girl" at his concert was a big deal. After all, "Uptown Girl" was an incredibly popular song that generations of people have danced to. However, the reason why that song is special for the former couple is <strong>the role Brinkley played in the history of "Uptown Girl"</strong>.</p><p>How many top ten hits has Bill Joel released, according to Billboard?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Song:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Chart Peak:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>"An Innocent Man"</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"A Matter of Trust"</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Modern Woman"</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"You're Only Human (Second Wind)"</p></td><td><p>9</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"You May Be Right"</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"I Go To Extremes"</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"My Life"</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Just The Way You Are"</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"The River Of Dreams"</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Uptown Girl"</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Tell Her About It"</p></td><td><p>1 for 1 week</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"We Didn't Start The Fire"</p></td><td><p>1 for 2 weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"It's Still Rock And Roll To Me"</p></td><td><p>1 for 2 weeks</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-billy-joel-scam-his-former-drummer-out-of-30-years-worth-of-royalties_-the-truth-about-their-messy-lawsuit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Billy Joel Scam His Former Drummer Out Of 30 Years Worth Of Royalties? The Truth About Their Messy Lawsuit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Billy Joel's longtime drummer, Liberty DeVitto, took the music legend to court over years of royalties.</span><p>Before "Uptown Girl" was released in 1983, Joel ultimately wrote the song about Brinkley. During an interview with Howard Stern that was quoted by Far Out Magazine, Joel told the story about why he wrote the song.</p><p>As Joel explained, he began writing the original version of the song when he was dating Elle McPherson.</p><p>“What they were trying to do was debunk that it was all about Christie. I wasn’t even dating Christie when I started writing the song; I was dating Elle. It was an amazing time. That’s why I started writing a song called ‘Uptown Girls’. It was plural. I couldn’t believe the situation I was in; it was unbelievable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/elle-macpherson-in-front-of-the-paparazzi.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, as Joel explained to Stern, the song went through a huge change after he broke up with McPherson. Following Joel and McPherson's split, he went on to begin dating Christie Brinkley. As Joel told Stern, the version of "Uptown Girl" that was released <strong>was written about Brinkley</strong>.</p><p>“Then I started to date Christie, after Elle and I had stopped dating. Rather than the song being about all these different girls, she became the uptown girl. I started writing it about one person. They got the story wrong. It is about Christie.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-40.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Hugh Jackman Has Become 'Odd And Erratic' Because Of His Divorce From Deborra-Lee Furness</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Hugh Jackman's divorce from Deborra-Lee Furness has led to his "odd and erratic" social media activity, according to an insider.</span><p>On top of "Uptown Girl" being written about Brinkley, the supermodel also played a major role in the song's promotion upon its release.</p><p>When "Uptown Girl" was released as a single, one of the keys to its success was its popular music video. That music video, which was in heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic at the time, starred Joel and Brinkley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/billy-joel-and-christie-brinkley-from-the-music-video-for-uptown-girl.jpg><p>Between the fact that Brinkley inspired and helped promote "Uptown Girl", there is no doubt that she is heavily associated with the song.
