The couple, who got married in 2006, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their first child</a>, daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Willow Sage</a></strong>, in June 2011. Five years later, their son <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jameson Moon</strong></a> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>joined the family</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pink-Kids-Willow-Jameson-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Pink, whose real name is <strong>Alecia Beth Moore</strong>,&nbsp;loves being a mom so much. But recently, she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;that she was initially “terrified” to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>have children</a> because she was worried she’d “be a terrible mother.” And she couldn’t have been more wrong! “But, oh my God, being a mom is the most incredible thing I’ve ever done,” Pink also said in that interview. “It’s shocking how responsible I’ve become.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Most recently, the songstress took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a> on October 16, 2023, to reveal that her family had to deal with urgent “medical issues.” Due to the health scare, Pink was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>forced to postpone</a> two of her upcoming tour dates in Tacoma, WA. “TACOMA SHOWS POSTPONED: I AM SO SORRY TO INFORM THE TACOMA TICKET HOLDERS THAT THE TWO SHOWS OCTOBER 17 AND OCTOBER 18 (TOMORROW AND WEDNESDAY) WILL BE POSTPONED,” her statement began.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“LIVE NATION ARE WORKING ON FUTURE DATES TO RESCHEDULE. FAMILY <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MEDICAL ISSUES</a> REQUIRE OUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION,” Pink went on to write. “I SEND EVERYONE MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THIS HAS CAUSED. I AM SENDING NOTHING BUT LOVE AND HEALTH TO ALL.” Aside from the Tacoma dates, Pink is set to perform in Vancouver, B.C. on October 20. Below is everything you need to know about Pink’s two children, Willow and Jameson, amid the health scare.</p><h2>Willow Sage Hart</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Pink’s daughter was born on June 2, 2011. “We are ecstatic to welcome our new beautiful healthy happy baby girl, Willow Sage Hart,” Pink <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote on Twitter</a> when she announced her daughter’s arrival. “She’s gorgeous, just like her daddy #beyondblessed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Willow, now 12, has followed in her mother’s footsteps as a performer. In December 2020, Pink and Willow teamed up for The Disney Holiday Singalong where they performed a duet of the classic <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“The Christmas Song.”</a>&nbsp;Willow was then featured on her mom’s 2021 single “Cover Me In Sunshine,” dueting with the popstar on a heartfelt ballad. A few months later, Willow&nbsp;joined her mom on stage at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2021 Billboard Music Awards</a> for an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>impressive aerial routine</a>. Willow also has other passions that Pink revealed in a 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “Willow does gymnastics and reads Harry Potter and is convinced she’s going to Hogwarts when she’s 11, and I don’t have the heart to tell her that she’s not,” the “So What” singer said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pink-Kids-Willow-Jameson-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Ahead of her upcoming&nbsp;<i>Trustfall&nbsp;</i>tour, Pink revealed on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Drew Barrymore Show&nbsp;</a>that she sat Willow down to talk about how they’re going to be spending a lot of time apart soon. “Willow and I had a really teary conversation about this tour because she has needs now,” Pink said. “Willow and I talk about almost everything — we have a great relationship and I told her, I said, ‘I know you have things that you want to do.’ This time, it means we’re going to have to miss each other a little bit occasionally. I’ve never been away from them.” Pink and Willow have the sweetest relationship!</p><h2>Jameson Moon Hart</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Pink’s son was born on December 26, 2016, and she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced his arrival</a> on Instagram. The singer shared a photo of her husband holding baby Jameson, with the caption, “I love my baby daddy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Jameson, now 6, is the most adorable little boy and he’s so loved by both his parents. Pink frequently posts footage of Jameson doing all kinds of different activities on her social media. Jameson has also been to many red carpet events with his famous mom and the rest of their family. In an interview with&nbsp;PEOPLE, Pink revealed that her son “wants to be an astronaut.” She also said that both Jameson and Willow are “normal kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Pink expressed her love for Jameson when he turned 6 in December 2022. The “Try” singer shared an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram tribute</a> to her son where she called him a “miracle” and said that having him “exploded my head and my heart and made me bigger.” Pink also wrote to Jameson, “You are a miracle because you choose joy every single day. You make every room brighter, every life you touch happier, truer.. you are full body feelings. This world needs what you have. Thank you for being you. I adore you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2BipaRlm56xtHmUaWxscWdlfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpink-kids-5053970.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpink-kids-5053970.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpink-kids-5053970.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpink-kids-5053970.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpink-kids-5053970.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpink-kids-5053970.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nfl-prop-bets-today-week-16-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nfl-prop-bets-today-week-16-2023.html>NFL Prop Bets Today: Week 16, 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mark-packer-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Mark Packer Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mark-packer-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
