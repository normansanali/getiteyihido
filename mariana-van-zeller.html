She rose to the occasion, well conscious of the gravity of the situation, and delivered the news to a nation watching her with bated breath.</p><p>Van Zeller moved to London after finishing her studies at Columbia, where she engaged herself in documentary production. She traveled to Syria to study Arabic at Damascus University in order to cover the Iraq War, boosting her abilities to unearth stories in the Middle East.
