<time>22 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=293 data-injectable=true data-video=true>During <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Punch Man</a></strong>’s Chapter 168, the main character unlocks a surprising new ability that left a significant part of its readers confused. If you’re part of that group, you might want to stick around because we’re about to break it down (with as little scientific detail as possible).</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=703 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>One Punch Man is one of the most popular manga out there, with its incredible fight scenes and comedic writing hooking the audience since its release in 2009. With its huge success, it’s no wonder that an anime adaptation was created, airing for the first time in 2015. The story follows Saitama, an initially regular man who gains superhuman abilities, growing so powerful that he’s able to defeat his enemies with a single punch. And no, he didn’t need to get bitten by a radioactive spider or infused with superhero serum for that to happen. Saitama earned his power the old-fashioned way — by exercising a lot. And losing all his hair in the process, but that’s neither here nor there.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Although there is some debate on whether that’s all there is to Saitama’s origin story, one thing that can’t be refuted is that he’s one of, if not the most powerful character in anime and manga history. In theory, reading about an overpowered hero could quickly get boring, but One Punch Man constantly manages to keep its audience engaged. Proof of this is Chapter 168, where the protagonist pulls off a move so incredible that it left readers incredulous – the Zero Punch. But, before we get to that, a little context is necessary.</p><h2 id=h-what-leads-up-to-the-zero-punch data-injectable=false>What leads up to the Zero Punch?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=true>While we’re used to seeing Saitama pretty relaxed when he fights, because his power is usually unmatched, recent events have forced the protagonist to get serious. One thing to note is that, in this universe, a hero’s power can increase when that hero copies another’s attacks. So, in order to provoke Saitama into unleashing his full power so he can copy it, Garou, a hero hunter touched by God, kills Genos, Saitama’s disciple and companion, and the outcome is what Garou asked for – kind of.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Getting seriously into the fight due to this surge of emotion, Saitama decides to turn Garou’s plan against him and starts copying his enemy’s moves instead. This means that with every punch, Saitama’s power starts growing exponentially, quickly surpassing Garou’s by a mile. To give you a notion of Saitama’s ridiculous strength at this point, know that he accidentally blows up Jupiter’s surface with a sneeze. Yeah, that’s how powerful we’re talking here.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>After some more fighting and emotional development, Garou acknowledges his defeat and requests that Saitama copy more of his techniques to surpass him even further, mastering the power of God. And by doing so, Saitama gains the ability to travel back in time. Now, here’s where stuff gets tricky.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Zero Punch, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Punch-Man-Saitama.jpg><p data-characters=688 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>While time traveling, Saitama sees memories of his battle with Garou and comes face to face with a moment in the past where Garou hasn’t killed Genos yet, and thus his actual fight with the protagonist hasn’t even begun. At this key moment, Future Saitama throws a punch at Past Garou, defeating him instantly due to Saitama’s power growth in battle. This stops Garou from killing Genos in the new present, which means that the cause of Saitama’s power growth never happens. This is the perfect example of a paradox because if Saitama never grows his power, he’s not able to time travel, and is not able to throw that punch that saves Genos’ life. And so on the loop goes.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>To avoid this paradox, present and future Saitama merge into one, and the future memories are completely wiped out of Saitama’s mind. This leaves us with a Garou defeated by a punch that wasn’t thrown in the current version of reality because that future no longer exists. Hence, it actually took present Saitama zero punches to win the battle, and thus this is named Saitama’s Zero Punch move.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Phew, that was a lot. Hopefully, you were able to follow along with this simplified explanation. If you’re interested in One Punch Man, you’ll be pleased to know that newer manga chapters are currently available. And if you haven’t already checked out the anime adaptation, you can binge the first and second seasons on Crunchyroll, Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWS8r7GMqaynm5hiuqK6jKGmsGWUpLK0edKaoK2ZnZbAbrrEsGSznaKkerHBzZyfZq%2Bfp7hw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fone-punch-man-how-does-saitamas-new-zero-punch-work.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fone-punch-man-how-does-saitamas-new-zero-punch-work.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fone-punch-man-how-does-saitamas-new-zero-punch-work.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fone-punch-man-how-does-saitamas-new-zero-punch-work.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fone-punch-man-how-does-saitamas-new-zero-punch-work.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fone-punch-man-how-does-saitamas-new-zero-punch-work.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lizzo-amas-2019-dress-performance-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lizzo-amas-2019-dress-performance-photos.html>Singer Stuns On The Red Carpet Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nuchas-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html>Nuchas Shark Tank Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nuchas-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
